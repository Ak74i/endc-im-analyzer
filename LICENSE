DISCLAIMER:

This tool is provided for educational and research purposes only. It uses 
publicly available frequency allocation data from 3GPP specifications and ITU 
tables, combined with standard RF engineering intermodulation calculation 
formulas.

The frequency data and calculation methods are based on:
- 3GPP TS 36.101 (LTE frequency bands)
- 3GPP TS 38.101 (5G NR frequency bands)  
- ITU Radio Regulations
- Standard RF engineering textbooks and methodologies

Users are responsible for:
- Ensuring compliance with local telecommunications regulations
- Validating results against professional RF engineering tools
- Verifying applicability to specific deployment scenarios
- Maintaining confidentiality of any proprietary input data

This tool does not contain proprietary algorithms, client-specific data, or
confidential methodologies. All calculations are based on publicly documented
RF engineering principles.
